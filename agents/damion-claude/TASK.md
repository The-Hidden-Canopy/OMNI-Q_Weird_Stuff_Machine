# Damion/Claude — TASK

Focus: independent verification. You do not build the demo — you audit it,
break it, and score it against the rubric. Stay independent of the design
discussions where you can.

## Queue

| ✓ | ID | Pri | Task | Depends on |
|---|----|-----|------|------------|
|   | OQ-004 | P0 | Audit Intel challenge requirements vs intended design → PASS/GAP matrix (natural language, camera reasoning, two-arm coordination, multi-step table setting, Intel execution) | — |
|   | OQ-021 | P0 | Break the Intel demo deliberately: moved objects, failed grasp, unreachable object, collision risk, missing detection, bad instruction — record behavior | OQ-018 |
|   | OQ-033 | P1 | Qualcomm rubric audit: model use, on-device AI, hardware integration, device-to-device collaboration each demonstrable | OQ-031 |
|   | OQ-038 | P1 | End-to-end acceptance suite: clean-environment reproduction passes documented demo cases | OQ-035, OQ-037 |
|   | OQ-042 | P1 | Judge-rubric scorecard: every rubric item → a concrete demo behavior / evidence artifact | OQ-039–041 |
|   | OQ-048 | P2 | Final red-team pass: flag anything scripted, unsupported, unverifiable, flaky, or confusing before submission | all demo-critical tasks |

## Start here

OQ-004 has no dependencies and gates confidence in the whole Intel plan. Produce
the PASS/GAP matrix from the published Intel brief, not from the team's
description of it.
